Before contribute something:

1. Your code should look like all the other code - this project should look like it was written by one man, always.
2. If you want to propose something - just create an issue and describe your question with as much description as you can.
3. Please never send issues or pull requests about code style, jshint violations etc - I do not accept it (and you will spend your time for free).
4. If you think you have some general improvement, consider creating a pull request with it.
5.
